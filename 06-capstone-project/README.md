# Project: Data Engineering Capstone Project

## Project Goals

Main goal of the project is to building Data Lake for demographic analysis and prediction in the U.S.

There are several datasets with raw data:

* `I94 Immigration Data`;
* `U.S. City Demographic Data`;
* `Airport Codes`.

Project focuses on creating data model for the future analysis and building ETL-pipeline using Apache Spark. The whole ETL-pipeline processes raw data, cleanup, apply data quality checks and store to the analytical area in the Data Lake according to data model.
Resulting database allows analytics and data scientists to find and predict correlation between demographic situation in different cities/states and immigration to this locations.

The project follows the follow steps:

* Step 1: Scope the Project and Gather Data
* Step 2: Explore and Assess the Data
* Step 3: Define the Data Model
* Step 4: Run ETL to Model the Data
* Step 5: Complete Project Write Up

Full documentation and ETL-pipeline source code you can find in the Jupyter notebook [capstone_project.ipynb](./capstone_project.ipynb).
